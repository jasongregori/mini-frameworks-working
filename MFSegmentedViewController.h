/*
 
 MFSegmentedViewController shows a segmented control in the nav's title view which it uses to select which view to show.
 
 During init, pass in names and view blocks. View blocks are simple blocks that create a new view to show for that name.
 View blocks are called when it's corresponding index is selected and their view is not loaded.
 View blocks may be called again if a view was gotten rid of due to memory pressure.
 
 Notes
 
 â€¢ You may add other views to the main view if you like
